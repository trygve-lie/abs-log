An abstract logger - Enables adding logging to modules without adding a dependency to a full log library. This way, the consumer of your modules can plug in their own log library of choice.

The API of this abstract logger conforms to the standard [Log4j interface](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/Level.html) levels.


## Installation

```bash
$ npm install abslog
```


## Usage

In your module(s):

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');

class AwesomeModule {
    constructor(logger) {
        this.log = abslog(logger);
    }

    doStuff() {
        this.log.info('Did stuff');
    }
}
```

The consumer of your module, using pino as logger:

```js
const AwesomeModule = require('AwesomeModule');
const pino = require('pino')();

const awesome = new AwesomeModule(pino);
awesome.doStuff()  // will now log on info
```


## Interface

`abslog` takes one argument. It takes an logger expected to be log4j interface
compatible.

If no logger is provided an object with log methods will be returned. Each of
these method are just `noop` methods adding minimal footprint and performance impact
on your module.

If a logger is provided, the logger will be returned. This leaves `abslog` adding
zero runtime footprint and performance impact on your module.

If an logger is provided but the logger is not compatible with the log4j interface,
an exception will be thrown.


## Methods

The log4j compatilbe methods are:

 * fatal
 * error
 * warn
 * info
 * debug
 * trace

Example:

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');

const log = abslog();
log.fatal('critital message');
log.error(new Error(), 'error message');
log.warn('warn message');
log.info('info message');
log.debug('debug message');
log.trace('trace message');
```


## console.log

`Console` is not log4j compatible, but `abslog` does support `Console` for logging.
Its worth noticing that its not recommended to use `Console` for logging in production
code, but it can be handy to just plug in `Console` to get log output in development.

Example:

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');

const log = abslog(console);
log.info('some message');
log.fatal('critical message');
```


## Known compatible loggers:

These loggers are known to be compatible and tested:

### pino

[pino](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino) is found to be compatible.

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');
const pino = require('pino')();

const log = abslog(pino);
log.info('hello');
```

### bunyan

[bunyan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan) is found to be compatible.

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');
const bunyan = require('bunyan');

const logger = bunyan.createLogger({
    name: 'test',
    stream: process.stdout,
    level: 'trace'
});

const log = abslog(logger);
log.info('hello');
```

### log4js

[log4js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log4js) is found to be compatible.

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');
const log4js = require('log4js');

const logger = log4js.getLogger();

const log = abslog(logger);
log.info('hello');
```

### winston

[winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) is found to NOT be compatible
out of the box. Though, winston can be customised with alternative log levels
and through such a configuration be compatible.

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');
const winston = require('winston');

const winstonCustomLevels = {
    levels: {
        fatal: 0,
        error: 1,
        warn: 2,
        info: 3,
        debug: 4,
        trace: 5,
    },
    colors: {
        fatal: 'red',
        error: 'red',
        warn: 'yellow',
        info: 'green',
        debug: 'blue',
        trace: 'cyan',
    }
};

const logger = winston.createLogger({
    levels: winstonCustomLevels.levels,
});

const log = abslog(logger);
log.info('hello');
```

### roarr

[roarr](https://github.com/gajus/roarr) is found to be compatible.

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');
const roarr = require('roarr').default;

const log = abslog(roarr);
log.info('hello');
```

### synclog

[synclog](https://github.com/trygve-lie/synclog) is found to be compatible.

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');
const SyncLog = require('synclog')

const log = abslog(new SyncLog('debug'));
log.info('hello');
```

### LogDna

[LogDna](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logdna) is found to be compatible.

```js
const abslog = require('abslog');
const LogDna = require('logDna')

const log = abslog(Logdna.createLogger('some_api_key_goes_here', {}));
log.info('hello');
```
